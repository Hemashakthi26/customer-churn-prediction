# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.  
Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company’s service.  
The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and build a model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn.
This project was completed as part of the **GUVI Data Science Course**.

## Dataset
- Dataset: **Telco Customer Churn**
- File: `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  

## Data Preprocessing
- Converted target variable **Churn** into binary format
- Handled missing values in `TotalCharges`
- Separated numerical and categorical features

## Visualizations
The project includes visualizations to understand:
- Churn distribution
- Relationships between customer features and churn
- Graphs are saved as `.png` files in the repository.
